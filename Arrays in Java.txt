2.How to create an array?
Ans-


In Java, you can create an array using the following syntax:
java
Copy code
dataType[] arrayName = new dataType[size];


3.Can we change the size of an array at runtime?
Ans-


No, the size of an array in Java is fixed upon creation, and it cannot be changed during runtime.


4.Can you declare an array without assigning the size of an array?
Ans-


No, in Java, you need to specify the size of the array at the time of declaration or during initialization.

A 1D array is a linear array where elements are stored in a single row or column. Example:
java
Copy code
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};


7.Write a program for a 2D array:
Ans-


Here is a simple example of a 2D array in Java:
java
Copy code
int[][] matrix = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};
